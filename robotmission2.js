// Qn 1

// It is time to get started with the ultrasonic sensor
// Write a program that will display (in the Source Academy) 
// the distance as measured by the ultrasonic sensor once every second.
// Note: you may need to apply a scaling factor.

// Qn 2
// Your next task is to use this distance information to 
// prevent your robot from crashing into obstacles!
// One such obstacle is the black box your robot came in!
// Write a program to achieve the following behaviour:
// Your robot should drive straight forward until it gets
// close the Lego box. Once the robot is approximately 10 cm
// from the Lego box it should stop and then reverse backwards for 30 cm.

// Qn 3
// Your next task is to program your robot to drive around obstacles.
// For this task we will again using the Lego box as an obstacle.
// Your program must randomly choose which direction to go around 
// the box. That is, on approach, it should decide to either go around 
// the left of the box or the right of the box (a 50-50 chance).
// Write a program to navigate around the Lego box. Your robot may be 
// placed pointing at any side of the box.
